## Database Setup
This project uses a MySQL database running on XAMPP. **Please note that the MySQL port number is set to 3308 in the code.** If your MySQL server is running on a different port, you will need to update the port number in the database connection code.

Here are the steps to set up your database:

1. Install XAMPP on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official XAMPP website.
2. Start the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
3. Click on admin, for MySQL which will lead to a phpmyadmin site.
4. Create a new MySQL database for this project.
5. In the project code, update the database connection details. The servername should be "localhost" or if yor using different port number->"localhost:(portno)", and the username and password should be your MySQL username and password.

## Usage
Once you have the Pet Adoption System installed and the database set up, you can start using the application. Here's how:

1. **Start the XAMPP servers**: Open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL servers.

2. **Open the project in a web browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_directory/initial.html` in your web browser. Replace `your_project_directory` with the name of the directory where you installed the Pet Adoption System. And if you are using XAMPP store the file inside htdocs.
